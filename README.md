# hello-world
My first github test repository. 
I am both a network technician for over 20 years and a gamer for over 18 years. I have worked for places as varied as a small shop that supported banks and law offices, to Union Planters Trust department and United States Postal Service. I then ran my own PC repair business from my own home, until needing to close it to care for an ailing parent. I am currently learning website development so I can work from home and will use Gihub for its shared resources.
